I'm a PhD student at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu), studying AI, ML, and natural language processing. My research interests include representation learning, natural language interfaces, and AI ethics.

I did my B.S. in computer science at the [University of Utah](https://www.cs.utah.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Ellen Riloff](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~riloff/). I grew up near Salt Lake City, Utah.

I'm deeply interested in science and technology and how they can influence the trajectory of our civilization.

In addition to my interests in science and technology, in my free time I like reading/thinking about mathematics, philosophy, {Chinese, Russian, Turkish, Japanese} history, urban planning, sociology of scientific knowledge, and art/architecture.
